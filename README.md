[Mawaribuchi et al. (2017)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012160616301142) has identified multiple W/Z-specific genes in addition to the major sex-determining gene DM-W: *scanw*, *ccdc69w*, and *capn5z*.

- scanw: protein comprising 628 amino acid residues containing a SCAN domain

- ccdc69w: protein of 48 amino acid residues that shares the highest similarity with coiled-coil domain-containing protein 69

- capn5z: predicted protein of 65 amino acid residues with a partial calpain III domain  

**Origin:** *dmw, ccdc69w, capn5z, and scanw might have been generated via the duplication of dmrt1.S, ccdc69.L, capn5.L, and scan.L or scan-like*

**Expression:** *transcripts for the three W-specific genes were only detected in organs of females: dmw, ccdc69w, and scanw were highly expressed in the ovary and liver, ovary and brain, and brain and stomach, respectively, relative to the expression in the other organs. capn5z mRNA was more abundant in the gonads and brain than in other organs. However, the expression level of capn5z was higher in ZW females than in ZZ males in the liver, brain, stomach, heart, and mesonephros, which did not coincide with its gene dosage.*

**Role:** Potential role in gonad differentiation. More data/experiments to further characterize their roles in sex-determination.

Role of ancestral copies of the genes:

- [ccdc69](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/cc.9.20.13387): role in regulating central spindle assembly

- [capn5](http://www.jbc.org/content/289/28/19383.full.pdf): nuclear protease

- scan: not exact matching in the gene name on genebank or xenbase. Publication on ZNF24:[Jia et al. 2013](http://www.bloodjournal.org/content/121/4/707.long?sso-checked=true)
