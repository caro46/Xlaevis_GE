# Scanw

### 31/08

Seems promissing. Seems to have more noise after the PAM in the Sanger sequence. Not as clear as the examples from the course but we pooled multiple individuals when they were embryos even when checking the red RFP color confirming that they should have been injected maybe not everybody were injected or the cutting did not work. Need to sequence individuals individually (not pooling).

# ccdc69w

### 31/08

Sequence from injected embryos too dirty to see anything.

- CRISPR-ID ([Dehairs et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep28973), [online](http://crispid.gbiomed.kuleuven.be/))

Can separate 3 sequences maximum. During the workshop we pooled 5 individuals... The software detected 4 sequences for scanw and ccd69w.
