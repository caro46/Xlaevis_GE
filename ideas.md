## Sex-linked genes

*When to do the injection during the development?*

The roles of the 3 genes are not clear. Maybe the impact would be hard to see. Maybe the easiest way to see the impact of the inactivation of these genes is to knockdown at the 2 cells stage. Using the 2 cells stage would allow us to have a "negative" within the same individual. We can compare both sides of the individual. We should be able to check that the injection was only done on 1 side with the Texas red. Of course we will need to separate the individuals injected from one side, and others done on the other side. 

Issue: Even if the injection is made in 1 side, both sides communicate and exchange information. So what we would see, would be less than the actual effect (sain side rescuing the injected side).

Advantage: If the impact is small, it will get rid of the individual effects (variation between individuals if for example the ovary is smaller).

Some days ago, found this publicaton of [Zuo et al. 2017](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-017-1354-4) that studies chromosome deletion with CRISPR/CAS. They were able to "delete" the Y chromosome, one X and an additional autosome. In frogs the sex chromosome are not diverged and have a lot of genes. However frogs are know to deal with crazy genome rearrangment (polyploidization...). I am pretty sure that to test the impact on the sterility of the lost the the hemezygous chromosome or the other, we can couple CRISPR/CAS edition and [Ira's technique](http://dev.biologists.org/content/143/15/2868). The sex determination occurs ~stage 50, while Ira used stage9. The mutations should be located in the reproductive organs but not be lethal since the rest of the inddividuals have a wild time.
